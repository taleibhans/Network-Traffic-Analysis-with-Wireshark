Google Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

This project analyzes real-world network traffic using a `.pcapng` capture file and a focused TCP stream extracted via Wireshark's "Follow TCP Stream" feature. It highlights protocol behavior including TCP handshakes, HTTP communication, and TLS negotiation.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Wireshark
- macOS for capture environment

## 📦 Packet Capture
- `googletest.pcapng`: The original capture file containing all packets.
- `googletest_TCPstream.pcapng`: A capture of the TCP conversation (extracted using "Follow TCP Stream" in Wireshark), which may include HTTP requests or other text-based protocol data.

## 🔍 Analysis Includes
- TCP 3-way handshake
- DNS query and response
- TLS handshake initiation
- HTTP GET request (if present)

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understand and identify basic protocol flows
- Follow individual TCP conversations
- Use Wireshark to isolate meaningful traffic
